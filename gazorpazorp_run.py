    # Assign each expedition 2 passengers (append)


    # iterate over list of expeditions and print


    # iterate over list of expeditions and print
        # iterare over list of passenger objects
            # print out passenger details


# create while loop here
    # Use input to get user input and generate object dynamically
# - as a user i can create passengers
# - as a user i can list all expeditions
# - as a user i can add a passenger to a expedition
# - as a user i can list passengers in one expedition
